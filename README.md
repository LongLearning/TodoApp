###Learning GOALS:

###Workflow

1. Choose an issue you want to work on. (I'll try to create them in logical order)
2. Create a local branch (issueNumber_descriptiveName)
3. Make your changes and update if needed this README
4. Push to origin/your_local_branch_name
5. Create on GitHub a pull request
6. Wait for my code review and make needed changes (you can start on a new issue on a different branch, if you don't need the new code to do so)
7. Merge it in GitHub to master.

###About this README:
Document here each step you need to do, when you need to setup the app. Update it whenever you added something to the app that needs special attention.
